Updating the chipster-microbial repo (CSC internal instructions):

1. Access:

Ask an owner for access to the csc-training repo if you are not already a member.

2. Structure of the repo: 

eLena_md: R markdown files for the exercises etc. 
	exercises-d1, exercises-d2: MiSeq 16S materials 
	IonTorrent: Ion Torrent materials
docs: html versions of the same markdown files (can be linked to course participants) 
README.md: determined what is shown on the front page

3. Editing: 

Because the markdown files need to be converted to html, the easiest way is to edit the markdown files on your own computer, convert into html and then upload both files to Github (markdown in the folder eLena_md, html in the folder docs). So start with git clone on your own terminal. Create a new branch, make the changes in the markdown file (for example in RStudio), use 'knit' to convert into html, move the html file to the docs folder. Add, commit, push, create a pull request, merge.
